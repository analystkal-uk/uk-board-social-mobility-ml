    "## üß† Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores social mobility in the UK by modelling the likelihood of individuals reaching **board-level roles** at major organisations, based on educational background, region, gender, and sector. Inspired by the **Sutton Trust‚Äôs Elitist Britain (2019)** report, we simulate this analysis using extended synthetic data to demonstrate how machine learning can quantify elite access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Data Source & Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real Report Base**: Sutton Trust (2019), *Elitist Britain*.\n",
    "- **Synthetic Extension**: Simulated board-level outcomes (`IsBoardMember`) based on trends observed in the original report.\n",
    "- **Key Features**: School type, university type, sector, gender, region.\n",
    "\n",
    "All synthetic data is clearly marked and generated only for skill demonstration purposes.\n",

    "## üîç Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Board-level roles disproportionately correlate with:\n",
    "  - **Private school education**\n",
    "  - **Attendance at Oxbridge**\n",
    "  - **Certain sectors (Media, Law, Politics)**\n",
    "- Regional imbalance also evident.\n",

    "## üß† Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Education and region continue to define access to top roles.\n",
    "- Predictive models show we can simulate risk scores for elite outcomes.\n",
    "- With real data access, this could become a board diversity audit tool.\n",

    "## üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add real HR data where possible\n",
    "- Build a shareable dashboard or API\n",
